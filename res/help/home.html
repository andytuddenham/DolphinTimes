<h1>Dolphin Times Help</h1>
<p>The Dolphin Times program runs alongside the Dolphin Timer, reading the files produced by the Dolphin Timer
 and sorting them in &#039;finish time&#039; rather than &#039;lane number&#039; order. This makes it easier
 for the referees to check that their finish order matches the Dolphin Timer.<p>
<h2>The main window</h2>
<p>The main window contains a number of race results, each race result has the race number at the top left, a table
below that has details of the times swum by each lane arranged in &#039;finish time&#039; order. There is also a
&#039;View...&#039; button at the top right which opens a new window containing just that race result.</p>
<p>The number of race results in the main window can be set in the DolphinTimes.properties file (see below).
 When this number is reached, new results are added at the top left and old ones are dropped.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the main window using default settings</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The program is controlled by a number of settings in the DolphinTimes.properties file, this file is read when the
 program starts.</p>
<p>The file contains a number of setting in &#039;key=value&#039; format. Each &#039;key=value&#039; pair must be on
 a separate line with no spaces.</p>
<p>The following &#039;key=value&#039; pairs can be used:
<table>
<thead><tr><th>key</th><th>default</th><th>description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>lane.count</td><td>10</td><td>specifies the number of lanes in the pool</td></tr>
<tr><td>race.count</td><td>all</td><td>specifies the number of results to keep in the main window (must be an integer)</td></tr>
<tr><td>header.font.size</td><td>11</td><td>specifies the size of the text displaying the race number in the results header, must be between 8 and 24</td></tr>
<tr><td>table.font.size</td><td>11</td><td>specifies the size of the text displaying the race results in the table, must be between 8 and 24</td></tr>
<tr><td>font.size</td><td>11</td><td>specifies the size of the text if header.font.size or table.font.size are not specified, must be between 8 and 24</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>any line starting with a &#039;#&#039; is treated as a comment and ignored by the program.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
lane.count=8
race.count=6
header.font.size=16
table.font.size=24
#font.size=11
</pre>
<p>If any of these settings are changed, the program will need to be restarted before they will become effective.</p>
<p>This is what the main window would lookl like with the above settings</p>
